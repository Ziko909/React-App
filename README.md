# React-App
This is a simple Micro Blog, developed as a [Single Page Application][SPA-link] written in [Typescript][Typescript-link] and using [React][React-link] to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

# What actually React is ?
[React][React-link] is a JavaScript library developed by [Facebook][Facebook-link] used to build user interfaces. It improves the rendering process using advanced techniques by updating only the necessary parts of the UI, resulting in fast and responsive applications. Additionally, it increases reusability in our applications by adopting a Component-Based Architecture, where the UI is broken down into multiple individual pieces called Components. React is declarative, meaning we describe how the UI should look at any point in time, and React takes responsibility for automatically updating the UI.
